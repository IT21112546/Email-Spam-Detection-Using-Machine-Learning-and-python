# Email-Spam-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-and-python
This project is a spam email detection system that detects emails as either spam or not-spam by applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques.
In order to create an efficient spam filter, we used a variety of modules and techniques when implementing this system in Python.

For the purpose of testing and training the spam email detection system, we have included a sample dataset.
